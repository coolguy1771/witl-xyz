## Alphabet Soup (some abbreviations commonly used in archaeology)

- BC/AD = Before Christ / Anno Domini
- BP = Before Present (before 1950)

### Relative dating Techniques

Relative dating techniques do not tell us **WHEN** an event occurred, but the **ORDER** in which events occured.

- #### Stratigraphy

  Archaeologists use stratigraphy to relatively date archaeological material. Uses geoglogic clues to show a record of what happened Validity of method depends on level of disturbance on stratigraphy. Radiocarbon dates at Gatecliff Shelter confirms that stratigraphic relative. Radiocarbon dates at Gatecliff Shelter confirms that stratigraphic relative.

- #### Serialization

  Seriation exploits the fact that human material culture changes through time. Style changes, technological turnover. Style and traditions increase in popularity, peak, and decline in popularity. Methods of artificial illumination in Pennsylvania provides an example of technological turnover over time. Plot shows the â€œbattleship curves. Seriation is applied in context where there is no date, only information about frequency of technology/style at different sites.Seriation is thus the temporal ordering of artifact frequency based on the assumption that styles increase and decrease in popularity through time.

### Absolute Dating Techniques

Absolute dating techniques vary in:

  1. The material they can date
  2. The event that they date
  3. The time range over which they work
  4. Their accuracy and their precision

- Accuracy: How close, *on average*, the age estimate you get from a dating technique is from the true age

- Precision:
  How much random error there is in the age estimate. If you were to re-date the same object, with the same technique,
  multiple time, how different would age estimates be from each
  other? How much would they vary?
