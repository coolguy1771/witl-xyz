# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications. In this post, we'll explore how to get started with Next.js 14 and its powerful features.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several benefits out of the box:

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- API Routes
- File-system Based Routing
- Built-in CSS and Sass Support

## Setting Up Your First Project

Let's create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Routing

Next.js 14 uses the App Router, which provides a powerful way to organize your application:

```typescript
// app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return Welcome to Next.js!
}
```

### 2. Server Components

React Server Components are the default in Next.js 14:

```typescript
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData()
  return {/* Use data */}
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 provides an excellent foundation for building modern web applications. Its focus on performance and developer experience makes it a top choice for React developers.
