# Hello World

Welcome to my first blog post! This is a simple example to ensure our filesystem-based blog works correctly in Cloudflare.

## How it works

This blog uses Next.js with filesystem-based Markdown files:

1. Markdown files are stored in the `/posts` directory
2. Next.js pre-renders them at build time
3. The pages are deployed as static content to Cloudflare

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, Cloudflare!");
}

sayHello();
```

## What's next?

In future posts, we'll explore more topics related to web development and deployment.
