## Cloudflare Deployment

This project is configured to work with Cloudflare Workers. Thanks to Next.js
static generation, all blog pages are pre-rendered at build time.

The blog functionality works by:

1. Reading Markdown files from the `/posts` directory during build
2. Pre-rendering the content into static HTML
3. Deploying these static pages to Cloudflare

### Setup for Cloudflare

Simply build and deploy:

```bash
bun run deploy
```

The filesystem access only happens during build time, not in production. Next.js
ensures that all necessary content is pre-generated and packaged within the
static assets.
